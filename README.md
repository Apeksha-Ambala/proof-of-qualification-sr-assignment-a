### Details for Assignment A ###

**Objective:**

Design a program that calculates the determinant of a square matrix.

**Design Specification:**

The matrix is represented as a two-dimensional array of floating-point numbers.
The matrix is read from a text file with the following structure:
- First line contains a single integer value which represents the dimension of the matrix N
- Thew N following lines contain N floating-point values which represent the sequential rows of the matrix. Values are separated by one or more blanks

  Example:

  4

  12.2 0.5 11.0 3.1

  4.0 63.5 12.8 0.1

  0.0 1.2 -0.7 16.0

  6.31 9.85 1.15 0.86


**Remarks:**
- The program should terminate on invalid input;
- The program should run realtime or near-realtime for arbitrary large values of N on a typical contemporary workstation.
